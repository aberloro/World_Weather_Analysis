# World_Weather_Analysis
Apply analyses, visualizations, and statistical skills while retriving JSON data from an API. Write code for a trip planning app that recommends destinations and itineraries based on weather preferences. 

## Overview of Project

  ### Background  
  Collect weather data from over 500 cities around the world via API. Analyse this data using Pandas, and plot the data using Matplotlib library and Google Maps API. Perform statistical anaysis with SciPy library to visualize relationship between latitude and various weather parameters. 
    
  ### Purpose
  ### Deliverables
  1) Retrieve randomized Weather Data via API call to [OpenWeatherMap](https://openweathermap.org/) and export to csv file that contains  
     - Latitude and Longitude
     - Maximum temperature
     - Percent cloudiness
     - Percent humidity
     - Wind speed
     - Weather Description
  2) Create a Travel Destinations Map based on min and max termperature preference inputs from the customer, and export those destinations to a csv file.  Map willl include:
     - Potential travel destinations within temperature parameters
     - Nearby hotels
     - A marker layer map with pop up markers showcasing Hotels and weather in those destinations
  3) Create a Travel Itinerary Map and pop-up marker layer that shows the route between 4 cities from the customer's possible travel destinations. Map will include: 
     - Hotel Name
     - City and Country
     - Current weather and maximum temperature
